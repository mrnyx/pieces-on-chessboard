# What's this?

There is a well known problem, called [eight queens puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle), where you got to put 8 queens on chessboard no pieces will attack each other. I'm planning to solve this for every (or almost every) piece (rook, queen etc.). It will probably will end as one general program.
